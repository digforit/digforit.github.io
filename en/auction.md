The Digger that has the highest sum of all their  [SCC](./scc.md "scc") bids each round wins the auction. Each new bid placed adds to your total bid for that round. Every new auction will end when the timer goes to zero. With the timer switch you can see the result of the previous round.

The [DIG](./dig.md "dig") prize pool is 1% of the total bets placed on the platform.
