The platform has multiple levels you can reach based on your plays. We have BRONZE, SILVER GOLD, EMERALD, SAPPHIRE and RUBY.
 
The amount of points gained is determined by the amount played.  When you reach a certain total your level will increase. As long as you keep playing you will hold those points.
 
**Points decrease**<br>
Every 24 hours your total points will decrease by the amount detailed in the table below. You need to keep playing to maintain your level.

**SCC Mining**<br>
On the platform you can obtain [SCC](./scc.md "scc") through mining system. When you place a bet on the platform you get a certain amount of SCC based on your level. The total SCC you get per bet of [DIG](./dig.md "dig") is :

TOTAL_SCC = BET_DIG * PLAYER_LEVEL_MINING_RATIO*GAME_FACTOR

**Example:**<br>
You are in the GOLD level and you place a bet of 10 DIG, you would get 10 µSCC(10 * 1 * 1) <br>
Note : 1 µSCC = 0.000001 SCC<br>
The game factor for LUCKY DIG is always 1<br>
