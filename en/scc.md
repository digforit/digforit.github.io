**SCC TOKEN**

The primary token of the "DIG for IT!" ecosystem, SCC was given out to funders during the initial funding round for the platform. SCC now exists as the rarest of the reward tokens within the game and can be mined by players. SCC is a TRC-10 standard token (6 decimal) that can be sent on the TRON blockchain, and traded on TRON based token exchanges. SCC has deflation built into its tokenomics, by utilising a "Buy-back and Burn" mechanism.


**Buy and Burn Mechanism**

"DIG for IT!" will use, at minimum, 15% of platform profits to do random market buybacks on the partner exchanges of SCC. All of the SCC that is bought through this process will be burned forever thereby reducing the overall supply of SCC. This deflationary system will help to support the token price and prevent large fluctuations in price for token holders.
