DIG FOR IT implements a provably fair system that allows players to check the integrity of every bet and confirm they have not been manipulated. Random bet results are generated by the use of a server seed, client seed and a nonce. The server seed is hashed and shown before the game begins. This ensures that the bet result cannot be modified during the game. Two seeds and the nonce are used to determine a random bet result.<br>
<br>
Server seed: This seed is unique and generated randomly by the server. You can change it once in 24 hours.<br>
Client seed: This seed is chosen by the client (yourself) and can always be modified.<br>
Nonce: Incremental number to ensure randomness of the client/server seed<br><br>

Each game mechanism will be able to check the result of the bets in the [Bank Historic](./bank.md "bank") screen </bank>
