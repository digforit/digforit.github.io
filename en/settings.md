The settings screen has basic functions you can turn on or off. The platform uses music, sound effects (SFX) and animations. For the best experience we recommend playing the game in full screen mode. Through the settings screen you have access to the [BANK](./bank.md "bank") and to your personal [PROFILE](./profile.md "profile"). When you want to logout of your session you can use the LOGOUT button.
