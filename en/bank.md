In the BANK section you can see your tokens you have on the platform in your personal wallet. The tokens you see here are owned by you.

The tokens we have are [DIG](./dig.md "dig"), [SCC](./scc.md "scc"), [TRX](./trx.md "trx") as well as future partner tokens. The tokens you win in-game are summarised and will be placed in the pending queue. When you reach a minimum for withdrawal of tokens then it will be withdrawn automatically to your wallet. Here is the withdrawal table:

In the historic section of the bank you can see your previous bets and actions. Here you can check the [provable fairness](./provably.md "provably-fair") of your bets too.
