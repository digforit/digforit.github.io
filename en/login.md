There are multiple ways to sign in to the platform. You have the option to import your private key to login. Security note : The private key doesn’t go over the internet and stays at your device.  If you don’t have a wallet , you can create a new wallet through the REGISTER button.

In Tronlink and other plugins you have the option to login through the browser extension. Then you don’t need to login with your private key, rather you can simply hit the TRONLINK button to login into your session on the platform. After the login you will be asked to create a [session](./sessions.md "session") password.
