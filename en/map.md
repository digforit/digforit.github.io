After hitting the PLAY button you come into the game board (8).
You have tools (1-6) at the bottom of the screen to DIG the tiles
The gems you DIG up from the board will be saved in the chests at the top of the board. When you have filled a chest you get the prize for that specific chest when the map is completely dug or you close the current map.

With evert DIG action, you have the chance of digging up extra tokens like [TRX](./trx.md "trx"), [SCC](./scc.md "scc") or [DIG](./dig.md "dig"). You also mine SCC with every dig as well! The higher [level](./levels.md "level") you are the more SCC you mine.

With every new game board the chests and map are reset.
